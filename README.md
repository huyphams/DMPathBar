DMPathBar is a Path Bar Cocoa control like the one used in Xcode to pick Targets or Finder in Yosemite (aka MacOS X 10.10) while browsing along a path.

I've made it to looks great in Yosemite but you can easily customize it for your needs.

As many other Yosemite controls, DMPathBar fully support animations for each available operation (add/set/remove/replace items) using a modern block style syntax.

<div style="width:100%;">
<img src="Example/Demo.gif" align="center" height="50%" width="50%" style="margin-left:20px;">
</div>

## A short introduction

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from your project.

Then you can create a new DMPathBar from IB by dragging a new custom view instance and set it to 'DMPathBar'.
You can also create it programmatically:

```
NSImage *myIcon = ...;
NSString *myTitle = ...;
DMPathBarItem *titleItem = [DMPathBarItem itemWithTitle: myTitle icon: myIcon];

self.pathBar = [[DMPathBar alloc] initWithFrame:NSMakeRect(0.0f,0.0f,300.0f,25.0f)];
[self.pathBar setTitleItem: titleItem animated:NO completion:NULL];
```
Each path item of the tabbar is a DMPathBarItem.
You can create new path bar with title&icon, only title or only icon (`+itemWithTitle:icon:`).

DMPathBarItem can also hold custom views too (using `+itemWithCustomView:`)

#### Actions

You can respond to the click event inside one of the path bar items by implementing the `.action` property defined as a block:

`typedef NSMenu*(^DMPathBarAction)(NSInteger index,DMPathBarItem *item);`

If you return an NSMenu instance your click on the item will open passed menu as contextual menu.
If you return nil it's just a simple click.

That's an example:

 ```
	pathBar.action = ^NSMenu *(NSInteger idx,DMPathBarItem *item) {
		NSLog(@"Tap on item %ld : %@",idx,item);
		
		if (idx == 0) {
			// Click on the title item will show a menu
			NSMenu *menu = [[NSMenu alloc] initWithTitle:@""];
			[menu addItemWithTitle:@"Item 1" action:@selector(test:) keyEquivalent:@""];
			[menu addItemWithTitle:@"Item 2" action:@selector(test:) keyEquivalent:@""];
			return menu;
		} else {
			// Do something with other items
			return nil;
		}
	};
}
 ```

#### Set Title Item

This method add or replace the existing title of the pathbar:

```
DMPathBarItem *item = ...;
[self.pathBar setTitleItem: titleItem animated:NO completion:NULL];
```

#### Set Items

You can set more than one items at once by using `-setItems:...` methods.
There are two setItems methods based upon the type of the animation you want to achieve.
If you want a single set animation you can use:

 ```
NSArray *items = @[pathItem1,pathItem2...];
[self.pathBar setItems: items animated:YES inSequence:NO completion:NULL];
```

while if you want a single animation for each add you can pass YES to `inSequence` parameter.


### Add Single Item

To add a new item at the end of the path bar use:

 ```
DMPathBarItem *item = ...;
[self.pathBar addItem: item animated:YES  completion:NULL];
```

### Remove Items

To remove the last item:

 ```
DMPathBarItem *item = ...;
[self.pathBar removeItemAnimated:YES  completion:NULL];
```

to remove all items (see 'Set Items' paragraph to learn more about `inSequence` parameter):

 ```
DMPathBarItem *item = ...;
[self.pathBar removeAllItemsAnimated:YES inSequence:YES  completion:NULL];
```

### Replace Existing Item

To replace an existing item in a path bar:

 ```
DMPathBarItem *newItem = ...;
[self.pathBar replaceItemAtIndex:0 with:newItem animated:YES  completion:NULL];
```

### Accessory View

Finally you can set an optional NSView instance (called Accessory View) as complement of your path bar.
You can position it both on left or right (see `.accessoryPosition` property):

 ```
MyViewClass *accView = ...;
[self.pathBar setAccessoryView:accView animated:YES  completion:NULL];
```

## Requirements
It works with OS X 10.10. It also should work on 10.9 but I've not tested it.

## Installation

DMPathBar is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "DMPathBar"
